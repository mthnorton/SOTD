# Private Application

This project is a private application consisting of a frontend and a backend. The frontend is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while the backend is developed using Python.

## Project Structure

├── backend
│   ├── app.py            # Main entry point for the Python backend application
│   └── requirements.txt   # Python dependencies for the backend
└── README.md             # Documentation for the project
```

## Setup Instructions

### Frontend

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the application.

### Backend

1. Navigate to the `backend` directory.
2. Install the required Python packages using:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the backend application:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```

## Usage Guidelines

- The frontend communicates with the backend via API calls defined in `app.py`.
- Ensure the backend server is running before accessing the frontend.
